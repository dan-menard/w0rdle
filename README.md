This is a really simple Wordle clone written in Svelte.

You can run it like any other Svelte app packaed with rollup:

`npm run dev`

Protip, some versions of OSX have a port conflict on localhost:8080, where this will run by default. You can override that by manually specifying a port:

`PORT=5080 npm run dev`

Happy W0rdling :p
